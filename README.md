## Deployment Process

### Step 1 ‚Äì Launch EC2 Instance
- Chose **Ubuntu 22.04** as the OS
- Allowed traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS)
- Connected using:
  ```bash
  ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@52.90.245.137
  Step 2 ‚Äì Install Nginx

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y

Step 3 ‚Äì Install Node.js and PM2

sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
sudo npm install -g pm2

Created a simple app.js backend:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/api', (req, res) => res.send('Hello from the backend!'));
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

Started it with PM2:

pm2 start app.js
pm2 startup
pm2 save

Step 4 ‚Äì Configure Nginx

Opened Nginx config:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Edited to add reverse proxy config:

location /api {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}

Saved and reloaded:

sudo systemctl reload nginx

Step 5 ‚Äì Copy HTML Landing Page

Used a simple landing page with Tailwind CSS showing:

    Your name and title

    Project title and short pitch

    About Me bio

    ‚ÄúConnect with Me‚Äù button

Saved it as index.html and placed it in:

sudo cp index.html /var/www/html/index.html

Errors Made & Fixes
Error	Cause	Fix
Permission denied (publickey)	Forgot SSH key	Used correct .pem file with -i
Nginx 403 Forbidden	Wrong file path	Placed HTML file inside /var/www/html
Node.js stopped after logout	No process manager	Installed and configured PM2
Nginx not routing /api	Didn't reload after changes	Used sudo systemctl reload nginx
PM2 app not auto-starting	Didn't run startup config	Used pm2 startup and pm2 save
About Me

I'm a cloud-first engineer passionate about building secure, scalable web infrastructure. I‚Äôve deployed production-ready apps using AWS EC2, S3 for static site hosting, Route 53 for DNS, and IAM for access management.
